"""Paste every runnable block into an interactive zsh and an interactive bash, and report the
blocks that break when pasted.

  auto-build/check-paste.py [docs/deployment-guide-keycloak.md docs/attachments.md]

A pasted block is read by an interactive shell, which treats it differently from a script: zsh
does not take `#` as a comment unless `interactive_comments` is set, and both shells expand `!` in
double quotes as a history reference. `zsh -n` checks none of that, and an interactive zsh refuses
`noexec`, so each block is run for real, with PATH pointing at a directory of stubs that print
nothing: no command reaches a cluster or the network. Errors are read from what the shell
reports while reading and running the block.

Each block is pasted twice per shell: with the shells' default options, and after the guide's
`shell-setup` block. A block that fails after `shell-setup` is a defect in the guide. One that
fails only with default options is listed for information: it is why `shell-setup` exists.
It also reads every block for variables named after zsh's special parameters (`status`, `path`,
`pipestatus`, `argv` and the rest): zsh makes some read-only and ties others to the environment,
so `local status=FAIL` fails and `local path=...` replaces PATH, in a script as much as in a paste.

Exit status 1 if any block fails after `shell-setup` or uses such a name.
